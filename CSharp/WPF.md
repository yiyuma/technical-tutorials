## Layout Panels
- Grid: Arrange objects into equal, or uniform, grid regions. This panel is great for arranging a list of images.
- Canvas: Arrange objects any way you want. When users run your app, these elements will have fixed position on the screen.
- StackPanel: Arrange objects in a single line horizontally or vertically.
  - Properties:
    - Orientation: Horizontal, Veritcal (default value)
    - HorizontalAlignment: Left, Right, Center, Stretch
    - VerticalAlignment: Top, Botton, Center, Stretch
- WrapPanel: Arrange objects sequentially from left to right. When the panel runs out of room at the far-right edge, it wraps the content to the next line, and so on from left to right, top to bottom.
- DockPanel: Arrange objects so that they stay, or dock, to one edge of the panel.
  - Properties:
    - Dock=Left, Right, Top, Botton
- Note: Stackpanel will not constrain its children to the available size, whereas a DockPael will size the last child to occupy all remaining space.
  
## Layout controls
